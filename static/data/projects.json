    "description": "A sample book is a catalog of textile samples, or swatches, usually a small rectangular piece of the textile accompanied by description. The description varies according to the purpose of the sample book, and may include: pricing; technical specifications; performance characteristics; structural details. Sample books are also formally analogous to stitch libraries found in how-to textile hobby books; in those cases, the descriptions are usually instructions or patterns for replicating the swatch.\n\nSample Swatchbook is the design of a swatchbook template for the samples made in SAMPLER 1. Initially intended to frame the swatches as technical materials, in the process of designing and using the templates the team expanded their framing not just as documentation of a swatch, but also: the process of making the swatch; iterations of a particular swatch; and the identification of \"analagous materials\" to help support ideation around them as materials.",
