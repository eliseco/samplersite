Each object is textured with personal digital information. These textures contain chat logs, selfies, picture of drink cans. Digital information is invading our brains, competing for our attention and covering our lives. By mapping personal digital information into our living space, I hope to amplify our daily digital behavior to remind people that our lives are constantly being digitized. \r\nHow to interact? Click on any object in the space and you can change the texture attached to it. In the meantime, get your webcam ready and see how you fit into this real and virtual space.\r\n\n",

Meanwhile, the malposition is disclosed - all “planes” are set discretely instead of as a whole.The 2D aesthetic embedded in repetitive textures is inherited to the container of these textures - the diorama.",
